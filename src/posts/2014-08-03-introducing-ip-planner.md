description: I created my latest project after playing League of Legends and asking the question how long will it take my to unlock Champions? Champions can be unlocked using the the in game currency, Influence Points, which are earned by playing matches. I found online other people who were wondering the same thing as I, but many people chose to estimate the answer based on the playing statistics of popular players. I wanted a solution that could calculate an answer based on my own play history, and that's where IP Planner was born! It uses the publicly available Riot API to load a summoner's history and calculate the rate at which they earn Influence Points. Check it out here!
