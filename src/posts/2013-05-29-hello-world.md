description: Welcome to the new Netopya Planet blog! This is the successor to my old LiveJournal blog where I will be posting about all my tech projects, creations and reviews. The new blog has a fresh new design and is deployed using my own Flask application. I've designed this site to showcase individual projects that I'm working on or have worked on in the past, with each post having its own customizable image gallery. You can browse all the different projects, tutorials and tools I've built using the navigation above. Enjoy the site!
